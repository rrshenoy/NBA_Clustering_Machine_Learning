# NBA Player Clustering

Log:
- Tried searching for dataset which gives player statistics for all players throughout their careers. There were individual pages but no consolidated list
- All datasets for players were organized into seasons. So it would be a good idea to use datasets from different era's and see how players clustering differed in these!
- Used Advanced and Total stats as they would add more features, used PCA to reduce dimensions and KMeans with elbow to cluster into 7 categories
